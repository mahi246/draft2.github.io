        <p style="margin-left: 25px; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6;"> 
            A stock is defined as a share of ownership in a specific company.The benefits of investing in stocks include: capital appreciation <br>
            (when stocks prices rise), dividend payments(when companies distribute earnings to stockholders), and stocks also give the investor an <br>
            influence in voting for changes in the company. However, a downside is that there is no guarantee that the stocks you invest in will <br>
            increase in price, meaning you may lose money. Likewise, stocks tend to be a long-term investment and therefore you may not receive <br>
            a significant return on your investment until a long period of time. However, whether or not you make a profit depends on what price you <br>
            buy the stocks at and what price you sell them.

    <td style="line-height: 1.6;">Growth stocks are usually higher earning than other stocks. 
They are commonly bought in the hope of capital appreciation and rarely earn dividends.</td>
    <td style="line-height: 1.6;">Income stocks have the majority of their earnings through dividends. 
This type of stock provides investors with a consistent stream of income and is a company that is in mostly stable industries.

    <td style="text-align:center;">Blue-Chip Stocks</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="line-height: 1.6;">Value stocks are regarded as being under-valued but those who invest in them see potential. 
They have a low ratio of price to earning. 
These stocks are cheaper to buy but have a high PE(potential earning). 
Investors buy these stocks in the hope that the company will grow or the industry value will increase.</td>
    <td style="line-height: 1.6;">Blue-chip stocks are categorized as stocks in large and stable companies, however they do not grow much.
Though blue-chip stocks are expensive, they tend to be low-risk and usually pay dividends.

        <p style="margin-left: 25px; line-height: 1.6; text-align: center;"> 
            Before starting to invest in stocks, it is important to research the up and downs of the stock market.<br> 
            Consider what companies may do well in the future, and remember to diversify your portfolio with stocks <br>
            from different industries. Diversifying your portfolio will help lower the risk of losing your investments. <br>
            Then open an investing account, which can be done through many online services. As a beginner, start investing <br>
            with a little money and as you begin to get more comfortable start investing more money.  </p>
