            Mutual funds are a wise investment, especially for investors who are just starting out. <br>
            They allow investors to diversify their portfolio and invest in multiple companies at a <br>
            time. A mutual fund is when a company pools money from investors and then invests into <br>
            securities(stocks, bonds etc). As the value of the fund increases, investors receive dividend <br>
            payments and capital gain distributions. Capital gain occurs when securities are sold in a <br>
            profit, and then the profit is distributed to the investors based on the value of their <br>
            investment. However, you may also lose money if the value decreases. The past performance of <br>
            a fund helps dictate how stable the investment is but it will not determine your profit or loss.

        <p id="mfhow"> 
            To buy shares of a mutual fund, you can buy it straight from the fund or through a broker. When an investor buys a <br>
            share from a mutual fund, they pay the  per share net value and any other fees that occur during the purchase. If you <br>
            do not like the fund that you bought shares from, you can sell the shares back to the fund whenever you want. Before <br>
            buying a fund, make sure to look at the annual return and operating expenses of the fund.  </p>
